# Bible-Game
This is a Python game and a quiz, where you can answer questions and see if you can do it. 
This Python Game is called Bible Quiz, you can test your faith. So this game has 5 questions you can answer and see if you are right or wrong.
You can play this quiz, the questions are kind in the bible but it's a yes and no question. If you get it right you go to the next question and if you get it wrong you start again. Every question that you get right you get it right every point is 1 point. I also used Love Sandwich in my code.
